#### Service descriptions

**AuthService**: This service is used to authenticate the user. It has functions for login, logout and registration. In addition, it provides methods to obtain and set user authentication, user name and user role.

It also provides methods to search for users by first name, last name and email. It has an error handler to handle any errors that occur during HTTP requests.

#### Routing Module and Application Components

The application has a routing module that defines all possible routes and the components they are associated with. This module is imported into the main application module. In addition, several directives provided by Angular are used to include specific components in the HTML template of other components.

**Routing Module ('AppRoutingModule')**

This module defines all possible routes for the application and the components associated with each route. Each route is defined as an object with a route key and a component key. The path key is the URL that will be displayed in the browser and the component key is the component that will be loaded when navigating to that path.

**Basic structure of the application ('app.component.html')**

The application has a basic structure that includes a navigation bar at the top, a router-outlet in the middle and a footer at the bottom.

**Main application module ('AppModule')**

The main module of the application imports all the other necessary modules, including the routing module, and declares all the components to be used in the application. 

The components imported and declared in the main module are used to build the user interface of the application. Each component consists of an HTML template, a CSS stylesheet, and a TypeScript class that controls the logic of the component. The Component' annotation is used to define the component's metadata, including the path to its template and stylesheet.
